### Flag-classifier

I follow an image classification tutorial found here:

https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/classification

To add my own take on things I scraped flag images to make a flag classifier.

This is my first attempt at using TensorFlow and so is just an introductory notebook without any explaination of the steps involved.

I find the classifier to work perfectly for computer generated flag pictures, but fails for use on pictures of flags with background behind them.

This is likely due to insufficient training data.

I follow a simple classification tutorial found here:

Having concentrated on other projects for a while, I felt the need to brush up on the basics of Keras again before moving on.
