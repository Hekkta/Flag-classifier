# Flag-classifier

I follow an image classification tutorialfound here:

https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/classification

To add my own take on things I scraped flag images to make a flag classifier.

This is my first attempt at using TensorFlow and so is just an introductory notebook without any explaination of the steps involved.

I find the classifier to work perfectly for computer generated flag pictures, but fails for use on pictures of flags with background behind them.

This is likely due to insufficient training data.
